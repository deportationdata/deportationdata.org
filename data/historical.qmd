The mapping deportations project invites you to see the history of U.S. immigration enforcement not as a series of disconnected events, but as a pattern. For more than two centuries, U.S. immigration enforcement has favored Europeans and their descendants while targeting non-white migrants for exclusion, removal, and punishment. Although U.S. immigration law and policy have shifted over time, the nationâ€™s immigration enforcement regime has consistently produced this result.

The Deportation Data Project hosts the underlying data for the mapping deportations project, below.
