<p style="font-size:22px; background-color: #b5d8ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px;">The Deportation Data Project collects and makes public U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets. We use the Freedom of Information Act to gather datasets directly from the government, and we also post datasets that the government has made public proactively. We expect these datasets to be used by journalists, researchers, lawyers, and policymakers.</p>

We [post datasets](data.html)  in their original form. The original form is most useful to those with a background in data analysis, allowing these users to see exactly what the government provided in response to our requests and then make their own decisions about how to analyze the data.

We also provide [links to related projects](related.html)  that offer analyses, visualizations, and reports for journalists, attorneys, and the public based on these datasets. If you have questions or suggestions about the data, please feel free to contact us.

### {{< bi bi-share-fill >}} Share your data 

Let your data work for others! If you have public, shareable immigration enforcement data from a FOIA request or discovery in litigation, we would love to post your data (crediting you) or link to your data repository. We can help connect you with others who can create visual tools using your data and/or can help analyze it.
