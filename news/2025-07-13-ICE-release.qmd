The Deportation Data Project has obtained a new release of nationwide, individual-level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, now covering the period from September 1, 2023 to June 26, 2025. The new dataset covers sixteen more days than the previous (early June) release, and it also includes removals data for the full period (unlike the previous release, in which the removals data only reliably covered 2025). 

The new dataset, like the ones released in March and June, was obtained through a FOIA lawsuit against ICE brought by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, represented by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and Amber Qureshi of the Deportation Data Project. The dataset includes anonymized identifiers that correspond to individuals, allowing users to follow individuals through the enforcement process without learning their identities.
