The Deportation Data Project has obtained a new release of nationwide, individual-level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, now covering more than four months of the second Trump administration, along with about a year and a half of the end of the Biden administration. The anonymized dataset contains detailed information on encounters, arrests, detainers, and detentions.
 
The new dataset, like the one released in March, was obtained through a FOIA lawsuit against ICE brought by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, represented by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and Amber Qureshi of the Deportation Data Project. The dataset includes anonymized identifiers that correspond to individuals, allowing users to follow individuals through the enforcement process without learning their identities. In addition to the new data, we have released a [codebook](/docs/ice.html) that describes our (incomplete) understanding of the variables and tables in the data.
