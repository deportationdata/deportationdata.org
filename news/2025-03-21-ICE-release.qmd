The Deportation Data Project has now received and posted its first set of updated data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The new dataset covers the period from mid-November 2023 to mid-February 2025, and includes tables tracking encounters, detainers, arrests, and detentions. (ICE produced a table tracking deportations, but that dataset is unusable; we are seeking a new version.)

The new dataset ends after the previous dataset with unique IDs ends; that dataset covers the period from 2012 to mid-2023. Unfortunately, although the two datasets jointly cover almost the full period from 2012 to 2025, the unique IDs only match within time periods. That is, users can only connect the tables in the earlier dataset and the later dataset separately; IDs do not match across releases. In addition, the detention dataset includes only book-outs that occurred after November 15, 2023; this means that some information concerning individuals detained at the beginning of the data may be missing. 

We will seek a single release covering the full period, an update to make that release more current, and a usable deportations table. We welcome thoughts about the datasets and their shortcomings.

### New Data Details Increase in ICE Arrests Since Inauguration

The new dataset allows analysis of trends over time in arrests. Arrests rose sharply in the four weeks after the 2025 presidential inauguration.

### Arrests of People Without Criminal Convictions Rose Most

The new dataset allows analysis of trends over time in whether the arrested individual had a criminal conviction. Consistent with news reports, the new administration increased its arrest numbers partly by targeting people with no criminal history.
