<img src="img/hausman.jpg" width=250 align="right" style="padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px">**David Hausman, Faculty Director.** David is an assistant professor of law at Berkeley. He studies immigration enforcement, with a focus on data transparency. His work draws on the combination of a background in quantitative methods and litigation experience at the ACLU, where he worked as an attorney challenging the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. While at the ACLU, he gained knowledge of enforcement data that he now uses in his research, conducting depositions of officials who maintain databases at ICE and the Department of Justice. He has conducted data analysis as a consulting expert in numerous immigrants’ rights cases. He has also published scholarly research using these datasets, evaluating, for example, the effect of sanctuary policies (*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*), the effect of an algorithmic no-release policy (*Journal of Law and Economics*, forthcoming), the effect of the first Trump administration’s efforts to control the immigration courts (*Journal of Law, Economics and Organization*), and the effect of appeals on immigration court outcomes (*University of Pennsylvania Law Review*). He received his J.D. and Ph.D. in political science from Stanford University and clerked for Judge Stephen Williams on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

She has obtained favorable outcomes for clients in lawsuits against U.S. federal immigration agencies nationwide, including in litigation under the Freedom of Information Act, class action lawsuits challenging unlawful policies and practices, habeas petitions seeking to free people from detention, and lawsuits seeking money damages against the United States for injuries caused in immigration detention. Prior to starting her firm, Amber worked as an attorney at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild. She is a graduate of Yale Law School, Johns Hopkins University School of Education, and University of Maryland College Park. Amber grew up in Lahore, Pakistan. Her journey to the United States fuels her passion to help others navigate the legal system, ensuring they too can pursue the opportunities and freedoms she has been fortunate enough to have.
