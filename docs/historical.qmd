# Historical U.S. Deportation Data

The Mapping Deportations project invites you to see the history of U.S. immigration enforcement not as a series of disconnected events, but as a pattern. For more than two centuries, U.S. immigration enforcement has favored Europeans and their descendants while targeting non-white migrants for exclusion, removal, and punishment. Although U.S. immigration law and policy have shifted over time, the nation’s immigration enforcement regime has consistently produced this result.

The Deportation Data Project hosts the [underlying data](/data/historical.html) for the mapping deportations project. We provide documentation of the data sources below.
