We use the Freedom of Information Act to gather datasets directly from the government, and we also post datasets that the government has posted proactively or in response to others’ requests. We expect these datasets to be used by journalists, researchers, lawyers, and policymakers.\nAs a first step, we have posted the main datasets that we know of; in most cases, these datasets are out of date. We are seeking updates, and we will post those updates as we receive them.\nWe post mostly individual-level datasets. Individual-level data is most useful to those with a background in data analysis, allowing these users to make their own decisions about how to analyze the data.\nWe also provide links to related projects that offer analyses, visualizations, and reports for journalists, attorneys, and the public based on these datasets. If you have questions or suggestions about the data, please feel free to contact us.\nWe are grateful for the work of others, and especially of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), in first obtaining access to many of these datasets. Please get in touch if you have done relevant work in this area and we can do more to acknowledge your contributions."

His work draws on the combination of a background in quantitative methods and litigation experience at the ACLU, where he worked as an attorney challenging the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. While at the ACLU, he gained knowledge of enforcement data that he now uses in his research, conducting depositions of officials who maintain databases at ICE and the Department of Justice. He has conducted data analysis as a consulting expert in numerous immigrants’ rights cases. He has also published scholarly research using these datasets, evaluating, for example, the effect of sanctuary policies (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), the effect of an algorithmic no-release policy (Journal of Law and Economics, forthcoming), the effect of the first Trump administration’s efforts to control the immigration courts (Journal of Law, Economics and Organization), and the effect of appeals on immigration court outcomes (University of Pennsylvania Law Review). He received his J.D. and Ph.D. in political science from Stanford University and clerked for Judge Stephen Williams on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nAmber Qureshi, Litigation Director. Amber has extensive experience in federal court litigation on immigration and transparency issues. She has obtained favorable outcomes for clients in lawsuits against U.S. federal immigration agencies nationwide, including in litigation under the Freedom of Information Act, class action lawsuits challenging unlawful policies and practices, habeas petitions seeking to free people from detention, and lawsuits seeking money damages against the United States for injuries caused in immigration detention. Prior to starting her firm, Amber worked as an attorney at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild. She is a graduate of Yale Law School, Johns Hopkins University School of Education, and University of Maryland College Park. Amber grew up in Lahore, Pakistan. Her journey to the United States fuels her passion to help others navigate the legal system, ensuring they too can pursue the opportunities and freedoms she has been fortunate enough to have."

Guttentag founded the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrants’ Rights Project (IRP) and directed it for 25 years from 1985-2010, litigating complex class action and appellate cases on behalf of refugees and noncitizens throughout the country. He served in the Obama administration as a senior counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. His writings focus on the intersection of immigration, civil rights, and administrative reform, and Guttentag regularly advises advocates, NGOs, and philanthropies on immigration policy and litigation strategy. In 2017, he created the Immigration Policy Tracking Project with Yale and Stanford law students, a dynamic website profiled in the New Yorker and New York Times, that has compiled every Trump administration immigration policy and is tracking its current status. Guttentag has successfully argued major cases in the United States Supreme Court, the California Supreme Court, and many trial and appellate courts throughout the country. Guttentag is Professor of the Practice of Law at Stanford Law School and Lecturer in Law and Senior Research Scholar in Law at Yale Law School.\nMichael K.T. Tan.
