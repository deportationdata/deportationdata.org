Individual-level data is most useful to those with a background in data analysis, allowing these users to make their own decisions about how to analyze the data.\nWe also provide links to related projects that offer analyses, visualizations, and reports for journalists, attorneys, and the public based on these datasets. If you have questions or suggestions about the data, please feel free to contact us.\nWe are grateful for the work of others, and especially of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), in first obtaining access to many of these datasets.
