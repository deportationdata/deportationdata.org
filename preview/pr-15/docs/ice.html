This need not mean a physical encounter. Most notably, every time ICE processes a match between FBI book-in (i.e. to a local jail or state prison) information and ICE database information, that is logged as an ICE encounter. Generally, if an individual appears in the detainers or arrests table, that individual should appear in this table. An individual might appear in the removals or detentions tables without appearing in the encounters data if Customs and Border Protection initially encounters the person. This is both the largest and the sparsest of the tables, and in many cases, encounters lack a unique ID because the individual lacked an A number.","This table includes all requests to jails and prison either for a person to be held on a detainer or for a notification of release date and time. A detainer is a request to a local jail to hold someone for 48 hours beyond when they otherwise would be released so that ICE can make an arrest in the jail while the individual remains detained.","This table includes every time ICE arrests someone, whether or not that arrest results in a decision to detain the person, or issues a Notice to Appear (NTA)--the documents that start a deportation case. Note that other agencies also issue NTAs, and those would not appear in this dataset. We treat \"apprehensions\" and \"arrests\" or \"administrative arrests\" as synonyms.","This table includes each detention from book-in to book-out; most individuals have more than one detention because they are transferred between detention centers (or are detained separately more than once) and therefore appear in more than one row.","This table includes every deportation that ICE conducts, with a row for each individual deportation. An individual only has more than one row if that individual was deported more than once. Note that expulsions may occur directly at the border, by CBP, without involving ICE."]},"columns":[{"id":"Name","name":"Name","type":"character","cell":[{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Encounters"},"children":["Encounters"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Detainers"},"children":["Detainers"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Administrative Arrests (aka Arrests aka Apprehensions)"},"children":["Administrative Arrests (aka Arrests aka Apprehensions)"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Detentions"},"children":["Detentions"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Removals"},"children":["Removals"]}]},{"id":"Description","name":"Description","type":"character"}],"pagination":false,"striped":true,"dataKey":"8753ef6a0f64a7b3fc55ee61761251ea"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":{"render":[{"code":"\n    function(el) {\n      // If there's a hash on load or after clicking a link, scroll smoothly\n      function scrollToHash() {\n        if (!location.hash) return;\n        const target = el.querySelector(location.hash);\n        if (target) target.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center'});\n      }\n      scrollToHash();\n      window.addEventListener('hashchange', scrollToHash, false);\n    }\n  ","data":null}]}}</script>

A \"stay\" describes the full period from when an individual enters detention to when the individual leaves detention. Each row describes something more specific: the period spent by an individual in one given detention center from book-in to book-out. Most \"stays\" cover multiple rows because individuals are transferred between detention centers. It is also possible for an individual to have multiple stays in detention (each one of which might involve multiple rows) if, for example, the individual is bonded out of detention and later redetained. In practical data analysis, one can define a stay by the combination of the unique ID and a given stay_book_in_date or stay_book_out_date (but make sure to exclude missing IDs).","This field marks the beginning of a stay in detention--that is, an individual's full period in detention from book-in to book-out, regardless of the number of transfers.","This field marks the beginning of an individual's time in a particular detention center.","Name of the detention facility","Short code for detention facility, sometimes known as DETLOC.","This field marks the end of an individual's time in a particular detention center.
