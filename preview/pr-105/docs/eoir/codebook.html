<p>We provide a codebook for the EOIR Case dataset. The codebook is a work in progress; there are many things we do not understand in the data, and some of our educated guesses here may be mistaken. We will continue to update the codebook as we learn more, and we welcome feedback and corrections.</p>

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-5dbcea1b7ba9b3162302">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Name":["Appeal","Appeal2","Application","Bond","Case","Case Identifier","Case Priority History","Charge","Court Motions","Custody History","EOIR Attorney","Federal Courts Appeal","Juvenile History","Lead and Rider","Pro Bono","Proceeding","Reps Assigned","Schedule","Three Member Referrals"],"Description":["This table tracks decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Each row in the table corresponds to a single appeal. One case can include multiple appeals, and some appeal types occur without an initial immigration judge decision.","This table includes only idnappeal, idnproceeding, and idncase numbers. We’re unsure what purpose it serves.","In this row, each row indicates a single application for relief, such as asylum or cancellation of removal. One case can include multiple applications for relief—or none.","This is the primary key for this table. Each row represents a single bond proceeding. When an immigration judge alters a bond decision—for example, lowering a bond set as a result of changed circumstances—the new decision requires a new row in this table. However, when an immigration judge grants a continuance to a new date and doesn’t set a bond, the bond proceeding continues until the IJ reaches a decision and a completion date is recorded.","This table has one row for each \"case\" that each \"proceeding\" is associated with. We place those words in quotes because what the dataset calls a case is what an immigration lawyer would consider a proceeding: a new idncase is started when a new charging document—a Notice to Appear or, under the pre-1996 regime, an Order to Show Cause—is filed. Note that one individual can have more than one immigration case. For example, one individual may obtain asylum but later be convicted of a crime that leads him or her to be placed in new removal proceedings. Or an individual may be deported, reenter, and be placed in removal proceedings a second time. A \"proceeding\" in database terms represents a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue.","The table provides the case identifier codes added to an individuals's record for case tracking purposes","This table provides history information on the changes of Case Priority types associated with a case. Priority codes have been used intermittently as the immigration courts have changed which cases they prioritize.","In this table, each row corresponds a single immigration charge (e.g. ground of removability or inadmissibility). One case should always include at least one charge and can include multiple charges.","This table tracks each motion filed in immigration court. Note that some motions, such as motions for continuances, may not be entered in this table.","In this table, each row indicates a single period in immigration detention, but we note significant issues with the reliability of this information. Never detained cases should not have any rows in this table.","We do not see any uses for the current version of this table. Previous versions included attorney names and addresses.","This table tracks petitions for review of removal orders to the federal courts of appeal; it may also include some district court appeals via the habeas process that still existed for a subset of cases after the INS v. St. Cyr decision in 2001 and before the Real ID Act of 2005. We are unsure of the reliability of the table, and whether it consistently tracks all federal cases.","This table identifies cases that concern juveniles. Idnjuvenile indicates the status of the juvenile respondent—whether unaccompanied, accompanied, and/or released to a guardian. Note that this information overlaps with the information provided in the case priority field in the case table. Note that there are many difficulties identifying juvenile cases in the dataset; we recommend referring to Chiara Ghalli's work (LINK) here.","This table identifies consolidated cases--usually the cases of children (rider cases) attached to their parents’ cases (lead cases).","We are unsure of what this table contains.","In this table, each row corresponds to what the database refers to as a proceeding--a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue. Immigration lawyers would consider this part of a single removal proceeding; the database refers to removal proceedings as cases.","We do not understand the criteria for inclusion in this table: it includes some information about attorneys for the government in immigration court, but appears to omit many cases, even though there should be a government attorney assigned in every case.","This is the primary key for this table. Each row corresponds to a single hearing for a single individual. Where many individuals have their hearings calendared for the same time, at a so-called “master calendar” hearing, this table includes a row for each individual at that hearing.","This table contains information on which Board of Immigration Appeals cases were referred for decision by a three-member panel (instead of an individual judge) and what outcomes were."]},"columns":[{"id":"Name","name":"Name","type":"character","cell":[{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Appeal"},"children":["Appeal"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Appeal2"},"children":["Appeal2"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Application"},"children":["Application"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Bond"},"children":["Bond"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case"},"children":["Case"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case Identifier"},"children":["Case Identifier"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case Priority History"},"children":["Case Priority History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Charge"},"children":["Charge"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Court Motions"},"children":["Court Motions"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Custody History"},"children":["Custody History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-EOIR Attorney"},"children":["EOIR Attorney"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Federal Courts Appeal"},"children":["Federal Courts Appeal"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Juvenile History"},"children":["Juvenile History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Lead and Rider"},"children":["Lead and Rider"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Pro Bono"},"children":["Pro Bono"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Proceeding"},"children":["Proceeding"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Reps Assigned"},"children":["Reps Assigned"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Schedule"},"children":["Schedule"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Three Member Referrals"},"children":["Three Member Referrals"]}],"minWidth":100},{"id":"Description","name":"Description","type":"character","sortable":false,"minWidth":200}],"pagination":false,"striped":true,"theme":{"tableStyle":{"backgroundColor":"transparent"},"headerStyle":{"backgroundColor":"transparent"}},"dataKey":"1316ade7407c79d03e59a67640411d5b"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Our guess is that J stands for juvenile.","This field indicates the individual's month of birth. This information is only recorded in about 1/6 of all cases.","This field may approximate an individual’s date of release from detention, but we recommend using the release date recorded in the custody history table instead of this field.","This field categorizes the type of case. By far the most common type of case is a removal (“RMV”) case; that is the standard type of case in immigration court. There are also several far rarer case types. First, deportation (“DEP”) and exclusion (“EXC”) cases are the equivalent of today’s removal proceedings for individuals subject to the pre-1996 immigration laws. Second, “credible fear review” cases describe an immigration judge’s review of an asylum officer’s determination that an individual did not establish a credible fear of persecution (and therefore will be removed under the expedited removal scheme rather than have a chance to present a full asylum application in standard removal proceedings). Third, “reasonable fear review” cases concern IJ review of asylum officers’ determinations that an individual lacked a reasonable fear of persecution and therefore should not have the opportunity to pursue a withholding of removal claim before an IJ. Fourth, withholding-only (“WHO”) cases concern those subsequent withholding proceedings, if such individuals do obtain access to those proceedings. Finally, several other categories concern extremely rare cases, such as asylum-only cases dealing with the asylum claims of crewmembers.","This field contains priority codes used to prioritize scheduling of certain case types during certain periods.","We are unsure of the meaning of this field.","This field indicates whether an individual was never detained (N), released after some period of detention (R), or detained throughout (D). Because this status can change over the course of a case, we recommend relying on the proceeding and/or custody history tables for this information.","To the extent is usable at all, we recommend relying on the custody history table for this information. Please see our discussion of the custody history table.","This field shows the date an individual entered the United States. It is, however, missing in over a third of all cases.","We recommend relying on the custody history table for this information.","We recommend relying on the custody history table for this information.","We recommend relying on the custody history table for this information.","We recommend relying on the custody history table for this information.","We recommend relying on the custody history table for this information.","This field indicates the date on which the EOIR-28 form, which enters an attorney’s appearance, was filed. Sometimes attorneys file this form more than once in a single case or single proceeding, leading the date to be overwritten. As a result, these dates may be later than the first date on which an individual was represented by an attorney. However, it is safe to infer that an attorney did not enter his/her appearance after this date. This duplicates information (but not always) in the reps_assigned table, which may include earlier e_28 dates as well.","This is the primary key for the case table. It identifies the case (what an immigration lawyer would call a removal proceeding) that an idnproceeding is associated with. A new idncase is started when a new charging document—a Notice to Appear or, under the pre-1996 regime, an Order to Show Cause—is filed. Note that one individual can have more than one immigration case. For example, one individual may obtain asylum but later be convicted of a crime that leads him or her to be placed in new removal proceedings. Or an individual may be deported, reenter, and be placed in removal proceedings a second time.","We are unsure of the meaning of this field.","This field indicates the language in which hearings are conducted. Note that since language could vary from hearing to hearing, it may be preferable to obtain this from the schedule table.","This field is derived from the schedule table, and we recommend using that table to find this information.","This field is derived from the schedule table, and we recommend using that table to find this information.","This field is derived from the schedule table, and we recommend using that table to find this information.","This indicates whether an individual is a lawful permanent resident. However, the field is frequently missing and identifies under 7,000 cases as involving LPRs, out of over six million cases, so we do not believe it contains useful information","This field indicates the respondent’s nationality.","For information on release dates, we recommend using the custody history table (with caveats).","For information on release dates, we recommend using the custody history table (with caveats).","This field identifies an individual’s gender.

We are unsure what this means exactly.","This is the primary key of the case table, allowing the joining of case identifier information with case table information.","This is the primary key for the case identifier table. We are not aware of uses for this table.","This indicates the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act containing the ground of inadmissibility or deportability.","This field indicates the disposition of a charge. However, many charges lack any disposition.","This is the primary key for the case table. It allows a charge to be matched with a case (e.g. an immigration proceeding).","This is the primary key for the charges table. Each row indicates a single immigration charge (e.g. ground of removability or inadmissibility). One proceeding should always include at least one charge and can include multiple charges.","This is the primary key for the proceeding table. It allows a charge to be matched with an idnproceeding.","“Y” indicates that the immigration judge issued a decision in absentia. Where the field is either blank or has “N” entered, an individual was not ordered removed in absentia. (When the field is missing, that most often reflects the fact that proceedings are ongoing.)","This field is rarely filled in, and EOIR has suggested that it be removed from the database.","Indicates whether appeal due date has passed without an appeal being filed. To determine conclusively whether an appeal was filed, see the appeal table.","This indicates whether the right of appeal was reserved. It is marked “A” if reserved by the respondent, “I” if reserved by the government, and “B” if reserved by both. For information on appeals actually filed, see the appeal table.","This indicates the immigration court in which a proceeding was adjudicated in [link to EOIR website with list of courts]. A base city can have multiple hearing locations where immigration court is held--for example, a hearing might occur remotely at a detention center but still be based at the nearest immigration court.","This field categorizes the type of case. See lookup table for a full list. By far the most common type of case is a removal (“RMV”) case; that is the standard type of case in immigration court. There are also several far rarer case types. First, deportation (“DEP”) and exclusion (“EXC”) cases are the equivalent of today’s removal proceedings for individuals subject to the pre-1996 immigration laws. Second, “credible fear review” cases describe an immigration judge’s review of an asylum officer’s determination that an individual did not establish a credible fear of persecution (and therefore will be removed under the expedited removal scheme rather than have a chance to present a full asylum application in standard removal proceedings). Third, “reasonable fear review” cases concern IJ review of asylum officers’ determinations, typically in cases in which the respondent faces reinstatement of a previous removal order, that an individual lacked a reasonable fear of persecution and therefore should not have the opportunity to pursue a withholding of removal claim before an IJ. Fourth, withholding-only (“WHO”) cases concern those subsequent withholding proceedings, if such individuals do obtain access to those proceedings. Finally, several other categories concern extremely rare cases, such as asylum-only cases dealing with the asylum claims of crewmembers. For many analyses, a sensible preliminary step is to limit the dataset to include only removal, deportation and exclusion cases.","This is the date on which the immigration judge entered the decision in the relevant idnproceeding, regardless of whether the decision was on the merits (creating an entry in dec_code) or administrative (creating an entry in other_comp). Every comp_date has a corresponding value in either the dec_code or other_comp field.","This indicates the type of correctional facility, but it is not required and is frequently not filled in, and we would not rely on it.","This field is rarely filled in, and EOIR has suggested that it be removed from the database.","This field indicates whether an individual was never detained (N), released after some period of detention (R), or detained throughout (D). This field is set as of the completion date in a given idnproceeding. Note that this field sometimes is inconsistent with other detention information, such as the information in the custody history table; we suggest caution in relying on EOIR's detention information more generally.","This is the date on which the appeal was due to the Board of Immigration Appeals; that date can usually be inferred by adding 30 days to the date of the completion before the immigration judge.",null,"This date indicates the date on which an individual was booked into detention. Note that these records may be incomplete or inaccurate, since ICE is the agency responsible for detention. In any event, we recommend that users rely on information in the custody history table instead of the dates recorded here; those dates may also be unreliable, but they include more information where an individual experienced multiple periods in detention.","This indicates the outcome of the proceeding if the immigration judge issues a merits decision. Interpreting this code requires cross-referencing the case_type column; the same letter in this variable means different things depending on the type of case. The CourtDecision lookup table explains what each value means, but the only relevant values in that lookup table are those with \"C\" marked in the strDecType column; those with \"O\" marked in the strDecType column correspond to values in the other_comp field in the proceeding table.  If a value exists in dec_code, this indicates a merits decision; if a value is recorded in other_comp, that is a nonfinal decision, but some nonfinal decisions, such as administrative closures, are substantively meaningful.","This identifies whether a decision is written (W) or oral (O). We are unsure what other values in this field mean.","The first country of choice to which the IJ has ordered that the respondent be deported (or to which the individual is required to voluntarily depart).","The second country of choice to which the IJ has ordered that the respondent be deported (or to which the individual is required to voluntarily depart).","We are unsure whether this field is reliable, and we would recommend instead using  the schedule table, which contains information for each scheduled hearing, to obtain this information.","This is the hearing location of the respondent (the noncitizen). When a hearing is conducted by videoconference, this may not be the same as the location of the immigration judge.","We are unsure whether this field is reliable, and we would recommend instead using  the schedule table, which contains information for each scheduled hearing, to obtain this information.","This is the primary key for the case table. It identifies the case that an idnproceeding is associated with. This variable identifies roughly what immigration lawyers refer to as a removal proceeding; the idnproceeding variable identifies a subpart of a removal proceeding. A new idncase is started when a new case type begins (see case_type), or, in removal cases, when a new charging document is filed. Some individuals no doubt have more than one case. Unfortunately, there is no way to identify these duplicates from the publicly posted data.","This is the primary key for this table, and uniquely identifies each row. In an immigration case, a new idnproceeding ends whenever there is an outcome recorded in either the “dec_code” or “other_comp” field. This means that a new idnproceeding (and therefore row in this table) is created whenever (1) there is a change of venue or transfer, (2) a case is reopened after administrative closure or a motion to reopen, or (3) a remand from the Board of Immigration Appeals. An idnproceeding is therefore a subpart of a removal proceeding, which the dataset calls a case.","This field is rarely filled in, and EOIR has suggested that it be removed from the database.","A code identifying the immigration judge. Unfortunately, some IJs have more than one code. A single proceeding may have more than one judge associated with it. The judge associated with each individual hearing is recorded in the schedule table.","This indicates the date that an idnproceeding record was created. That date may not correspond to the date that an idnproceeding was initiated, since a record can be created after the initiation of a proceeding. To the best of our knowledge, there is another field, which is not part of the publicly released data, indicating when a charging document was received.","This field indicates the language of the immigration proceedings, e.g. English if not translated, and otherwise the language that proceedings are translated into.","This field indicates the individual’s nationality.",null,null,"We are unsure whether this field is reliable, and we would recommend instead using  the schedule table, which contains information for each scheduled hearing, to obtain this information.","We are unsure whether this field is reliable, and we would recommend instead using  the schedule table, which contains information for each scheduled hearing, to obtain this information.","We are unsure whether this field is reliable, and we would recommend instead using  the schedule table, which contains information for each scheduled hearing, to obtain this information.","This field indicates the scheduled hearing location, but we believe that more reliable information on hearing locations is available in the schedule table.","The date on which a case was received at the new hearing location after a change of venue or transfer.

However, this field is unevenly filled in.

It is not a required field, but where it is filled in P=In-Person, V=Video, and T=Telephonic.","This indicates the type of bond. BB=Custody Redetermination; BD=Motion for Bond Redetermination; SB=Motion for Subsequent Bond Determination.","This field is the completion date of the bond proceeding. In most cases, this is same as the date of the bond hearing (or, if a hearing was continued, the last bond hearing). [In order to identify additional bond hearing dates, one could also identify custody hearings in the schedule table.]","For information about appeals, we recommend relying on the appeal table.","This field indicates the bond decision reached by the immigration judge. Because no lookup table exists for these values, we provide them here:","This field is missing in nearly all cases. We recommend dropping.","This field indicates the date on whichan attorney filed the appearance of counsel (EOIR-28) form. However, this date appears to be unevenly filled in in this table.

Each row represents a single bond proceeding/decision. When an immigration judge alters a bond decision—for example, lowering a bond set as a result of changed circumstances—the new decision requires a new row in this table. However, when an immigration judge grants a continuance to a new date and doesn’t set a bond, the bond proceeding continues until the IJ reaches a decision and a completion date is recorded.","This is the primary key for the case table, and allows a bond proceeding to be matched with a case (e.g. an immigration proceeding).",null,"This field indicates the code identifying the immigration judge conducting the bond proceeding.","This field indicates the bond set by ICE in its initial custody determination.
