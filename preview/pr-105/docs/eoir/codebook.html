<p>We provide a codebook for the EOIR Case dataset. The codebook is a work in progress; there are many things we do not understand in the data, and some of our educated guesses here may be mistaken. We will continue to update the codebook as we learn more, and we welcome feedback and corrections.</p>

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6de05dce9fd102a9e52d">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Name":["Appeal","Appeal2","Application","Bond","Case","Case Identifier","Case Priority History","Charge","Court Motions","Custody History","EOIR Attorney","Federal Courts Appeal","Juvenile History","Lead and Rider","Pro Bono","Proceeding","Reps Assigned","Schedule","Three Member Referrals"],"Description":["This table tracks decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Each row in the table corresponds to a single appeal. One case can include multiple appeals, and some appeal types occur without an initial immigration judge decision.","This table includes only idnappeal, idnproceeding, and idncase numbers. We’re unsure what purpose it serves.","In this row, each row indicates a single application for relief, such as asylum or cancellation of removal. One case can include multiple applications for relief—or none.","This is the primary key for this table. Each row represents a single bond proceeding. When an immigration judge alters a bond decision—for example, lowering a bond set as a result of changed circumstances—the new decision requires a new row in this table. However, when an immigration judge grants a continuance to a new date and doesn’t set a bond, the bond proceeding continues until the IJ reaches a decision and a completion date is recorded.","This table has one row for each \"case\" that each \"proceeding\" is associated with. We place those words in quotes because what the dataset calls a case is what an immigration lawyer would consider a proceeding: a new idncase is started when a new charging document—a Notice to Appear or, under the pre-1996 regime, an Order to Show Cause—is filed. Note that one individual can have more than one immigration case. For example, one individual may obtain asylum but later be convicted of a crime that leads him or her to be placed in new removal proceedings. Or an individual may be deported, reenter, and be placed in removal proceedings a second time. A \"proceeding\" in database terms represents a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue.","The table provides the case identifier codes added to an individuals's record for case tracking purposes","This table provides history information on the changes of Case Priority types associated\nwith a case. Priority codes have been used intermittently as the immigration courts have changed which cases they prioritize.","In this table, each row corresponds a single immigration charge (e.g. ground of removability or inadmissibility). One case should always include at least one charge and can include multiple charges.","This table tracks each motion filed in immigration court. Note that some motions, such as motions for continuances, may not be entered in this table.","In this table, each row indicates a single period in immigration detention, but we note significant issues with the reliability of this information. Never detained cases should not have any rows in this table.","We do not see any uses for the current version of this table. Previous versions included attorney names and addresses.","This table tracks petitions for review of removal orders to the federal courts of appeal; it may also include some district court appeals via the habeas process that still existed for a subset of cases after the INS v. St. Cyr decision in 2001 and before the Real ID Act of 2005. We are unsure of the reliability of the table, and whether it consistently tracks all federal cases.","This table identifies cases that concern juveniles. Idnjuvenile indicates the status of the juvenile respondent—whether unaccompanied, accompanied, and/or released to a guardian. Note that this information overlaps with the information provided in the case priority field in the case table. Note that there are many difficulties identifying juvenile cases in the dataset; we recommend referring to Chiara Ghalli's work (LINK) here.","This table identifies consolidated cases--usually the cases of children (rider cases) attached to their parents’ cases (lead cases).","We are unsure of what this table contains.","In this table, each row corresponds to what the database refers to as a proceeding--a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue. Immigration lawyers would consider this part of a single removal proceeding; the database refers to removal proceedings as cases.","We do not understand the criteria for inclusion in this table: it includes some information about attorneys for the government in immigration court, but appears to omit many cases, even though there should be a government attorney assigned in every case.","This is the primary key for this table. Each row corresponds to a single hearing for a single individual. Where many individuals have their hearings calendared for the same time, at a so-called “master calendar” hearing, this table includes a row for each individual at that hearing.","This table contains information on which Board of Immigration Appeals cases were referred for decision by a three-member panel (instead of an individual judge) and what outcomes were."]},"columns":[{"id":"Name","name":"Name","type":"character","cell":[{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Appeal"},"children":["Appeal"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Appeal2"},"children":["Appeal2"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Application"},"children":["Application"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Bond"},"children":["Bond"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case"},"children":["Case"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case Identifier"},"children":["Case Identifier"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Case Priority History"},"children":["Case Priority History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Charge"},"children":["Charge"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Court Motions"},"children":["Court Motions"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Custody History"},"children":["Custody History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-EOIR Attorney"},"children":["EOIR Attorney"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Federal Courts Appeal"},"children":["Federal Courts Appeal"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Juvenile History"},"children":["Juvenile History"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Lead and Rider"},"children":["Lead and Rider"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Pro Bono"},"children":["Pro Bono"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Proceeding"},"children":["Proceeding"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Reps Assigned"},"children":["Reps Assigned"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Schedule"},"children":["Schedule"]},{"name":"span","attribs":{"id":"row-Three Member Referrals"},"children":["Three Member Referrals"]}],"minWidth":100},{"id":"Description","name":"Description","type":"character","sortable":false,"minWidth":200}],"pagination":false,"striped":true,"theme":{"tableStyle":{"backgroundColor":"transparent"},"headerStyle":{"backgroundColor":"transparent"}},"dataKey":"4ec66a0f3521626440f1ecf78da8728b"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
