<p>We provide a codebook for the EOIR Case dataset. The codebook is a work in progress; there are many things we do not understand in the data, and some of our educated guesses here may be mistaken. We will continue to update the codebook as we learn more, and we welcome feedback and corrections.</p>

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-fec129238263d30c9f90">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Name":["Appeal","Appeal2","Application","Bond","Case","Case Identifier","Case Priority History","Charge","Court Motions","Custody History","EOIR Attorney","Federal Courts Appeal","Juvenile History","Lead and Rider","Pro Bono","Proceeding","Reps Assigned","Schedule","Three Member Referrals"],"Description":["This table tracks decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Each row in the table corresponds to a single appeal. One case can include multiple appeals, and some appeal types occur without an initial immigration judge decision.","This table includes only idnappeal, idnproceeding, and idncase numbers. We’re unsure what purpose it serves.","In this row, each row indicates a single application for relief, such as asylum or cancellation of removal. One case can include multiple applications for relief—or none.","In this table, each row represents a single bond proceeding. When an immigration judge alters a bond decision—for example, lowering a bond set as a result of changed circumstances—the new decision requires a new row in this table. However, when an immigration judge grants a continuance to a new date and doesn’t set a bond, the bond proceeding continues until the IJ reaches a decision and a completion date is recorded.","This table has one row for each \"case\" that each \"proceeding\" is associated with. We place those words in quotes because what the dataset calls a case is what an immigration lawyer would consider a proceeding: a new idncase is started when a new charging document—a Notice to Appear or, under the pre-1996 regime, an Order to Show Cause—is filed. Each immigration case corresponds to a signal eventual outcome on the merits, such as a removal order or grant of relief. Note that one individual can have more than one immigration case. For example, one individual may obtain asylum but later be convicted of a crime that leads him or her to be placed in new removal proceedings. Or an individual may be deported, reenter, and be placed in removal proceedings a second time. A \"proceeding\" in database terms represents a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue.","The table provides the case identifier codes added to an individuals's record for case tracking purposes.","This table provides history information on the changes of Case Priority types associated with a case. Priority codes have been used intermittently as the immigration courts have changed which cases they prioritize.","In this table, each row corresponds a single immigration charge (e.g. ground of removability or inadmissibility). One case should always include at least one charge and can include multiple charges. We believe that the initial charges on the Notice to Appear are regularly recorded in this table, but we are unsure how reliably the table records updates to those charges.","This table tracks each motion filed in immigration court. Note that some motions, such as motions for continuances, may not be entered in this table.","In this table, each row indicates a single period in immigration detention, but we note significant issues with the reliability of this information. Never detained cases should not have any rows in this table.","We do not see any uses for the current version of this table. Previous versions included attorney names and addresses.","This table tracks petitions for review of removal orders to the federal courts of appeal; it may also include some district court appeals via the habeas process that still existed for a subset of cases after the INS v. St. Cyr decision in 2001 and before the Real ID Act of 2005. We are unsure of the reliability of the table, and whether it consistently tracks all federal cases.","This table identifies cases that concern juveniles. Idnjuvenile indicates the status of the juvenile respondent—whether unaccompanied, accompanied, and/or released to a guardian. Note that this information overlaps with the information provided in the case priority field in the case table. Note that there are many difficulties identifying juvenile cases in the dataset; we recommend referring to Chiara Ghalli's work (https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sf/soaf124/8222479) here.","This table identifies consolidated cases--usually the cases of children (rider cases) attached to their parents’ cases (lead cases).","We are unsure of what this table contains.","In this table, each row corresponds to what the database refers to as a proceeding--a single adjudication in a single immigration court, with new proceedings generated when there is an appeal or a change of venue. Immigration lawyers would consider this only part of a single removal proceeding; the database refers to removal proceedings as cases. Although proceedings are often only one portion of a case, they typically nonetheless include more than one hearing, and therefore more than one row in the separate schedule table.","We do not understand the criteria for inclusion in this table: it includes some information about attorneys for the government in immigration court, but appears to omit many cases, even though there should be a government attorney assigned in every case.","In this table, each row corresponds to a single hearing for a single individual.

Second, “credible fear review” cases describe an immigration judge’s review of an asylum officer’s determination that a noncitizen did not establish a credible fear of persecution (and therefore will be removed under the expedited removal scheme rather than have a chance to present a full asylum application in standard removal proceedings). Third, “reasonable fear review” cases concern IJ review of asylum officers’ determinations that a noncitizen lacked a reasonable fear of persecution and therefore should not have the opportunity to pursue a withholding of removal claim before an IJ. Fourth, withholding-only (“WHO”) cases concern those subsequent withholding proceedings, if such noncitizens do obtain access to those proceedings.

Sometimes attorneys file this form more than once in a single case or single proceeding, leading the date to be overwritten. As a result, these dates may be later than the first date on which a noncitizen was represented by an attorney. However, it is safe to infer that an attorney did not enter his/her appearance after this date.

It identifies the case (what an immigration lawyer would call a removal proceeding) that an idnproceeding is associated with. A new idncase is started when a new charging document—a Notice to Appear or, under the pre-1996 regime, an Order to Show Cause—is filed. Note that one noncitizen can have more than one immigration case. For example, one noncitizen may obtain asylum but later be convicted of a crime that leads him or her to be placed in new removal proceedings.

Fourth, withholding-only (“WHO”) cases concern those subsequent withholding proceedings, if such individuals do obtain access to those proceedings. Finally, several other categories concern extremely rare cases, such as asylum-only cases dealing with the asylum claims of crewmembers. For many analyses, a sensible preliminary step is to limit the dataset to include only removal, deportation and exclusion cases.","Date on which the immigration judge entered the decision in the relevant idnproceeding, regardless of whether the decision was on the merits (creating an entry in dec_code) or administrative (creating an entry in other_comp).

Interpreting this code requires cross-referencing the case_type column; the same letter in this variable means different things depending on the type of case. The CourtDecision lookup table explains what each value means, but the only relevant values in that lookup table are those with \"C\" marked in the strDecType column; those with \"O\" marked in the strDecType column correspond to values in the other_comp field in the proceeding table. For example, if the case type is \"RMV\" (removal) and the dec code is \"T,\" the decision is \"Terminated.\" By contrast, if the case type is \"RMV\" (removal) and the other comp is \"T,\" the decision is \"Transfer.\" More generally, if a value exists in dec_code, this indicates a merits decision; if a value is recorded in other_comp, that is a nonfinal decision, but some nonfinal decisions, such as administrative closures, are substantively meaningful.","Whether a decision is written (W) or oral (O).

It identifies the case that an idnproceeding is associated with. This variable identifies roughly what immigration lawyers refer to as a removal proceeding; the idnproceeding variable identifies a subpart of a removal proceeding.

In an immigration case, a new idnproceeding ends whenever there is an outcome recorded in either the “dec_code” or “other_comp” field.

An idnproceeding is therefore a subpart of a removal proceeding, which the dataset calls a case.","Rarely filled in, and EOIR has suggested that it be removed from the database.","Code identifying the immigration judge.
