<h1>Historical U.S. Deportation Data</h1>
<p>The Mapping Deportations project invites you to see the history of U.S. immigration enforcement not as a series of disconnected events, but as a pattern. For more than two centuries, U.S. immigration enforcement has favored Europeans and their descendants while targeting non-white migrants for exclusion, removal, and punishment. Although U.S. immigration law and policy have shifted over time, the nation’s immigration enforcement regime has consistently produced this result.</p>
<p>The Deportation Data Project hosts the <a href="../data/historical.html">underlying data</a> for the mapping deportations project. We provide documentation of the data sources below.</p>
