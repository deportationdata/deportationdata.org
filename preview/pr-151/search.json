Access to individual-level data (i.e. data including a row for each person or action) from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), has made this trend possible.\nYet no central resource has posted these individual-level datasets and offered guidance on their use. This data guide announces a new open online repository for these datasets, the Deportation Data Project at UC Berkeley School of Law (deportationdata.org). In order to help users navigate this resource, this data guide, cross posted on the Deportation Data Project website, describes the background and goals of the project and then offers a brief introduction to the main datasets and their relationship to the deportation process. It also offers links to existing journalism and research drawing on these datasets, along with examples of possible new analyses that the datasets make possible.",

    "text": "Announcing the Deportation Data Project: Collecting, Linking, and Documenting Enforcement Data\nThe U.S. government logs every individual immigration arrest, immigration detention book-in, immigration court outcome, and deportation. But this information is nonetheless difficult to use for three main reasons: 1) infrequent and inconsistent data releases, 2) insufficient linking across datasets, and 3) insufficient documentation. The Deportation Data Project aims to help on all three fronts.\nFirst, many of these datasets are not released proactively, but instead only ad hoc, in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to agencies that often have years-long response backlogs. This is not true of every dataset; for example, thanks to the efforts of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, the immigration courts post their dataset monthly. The Deportation Data Project will work to obtain data from the other enforcement agencies at regular intervals as well, bringing lawsuits to expedite FOIA releases where necessary.\nSecond, these datasets are siloed. The immigration court data is unconnected with the ICE data, meaning there is no way to know which ICE arrests and detentions correspond to which immigration court outcomes. And the CBP data is not connected with either. In other words, if an individual was processed at the border by CBP, the data fails to identify which rows in each dataset correspond to that individual’s possible immigration detention and immigration court proceedings. In fact, before a recent FOIA win, data was siloed even within ICE’s database in FOIA releases.1 While this problem is now mostly solved within the ICE dataset, the absence of linked data across agencies remains a central obstacle. A key goal of the project is to obtain these links between relevant agency databases through FOIA requests.\n1 For the court’s decision on the FOIA request and the description of the ICE Database, see generally ACLU v. ICE, 58 F.4th 643 (2d Cir. 2023).Finally, understanding the datasets requires understanding the complex institutional arrangements of the immigration enforcement system and drawing inferences about the meaning of the data despite often incomplete documentation. The project aims to collect the government data documentation that exists and supplement that documentation with knowledge shared with us by users of the datasets. This guide provides a starting place in that documentation effort, explaining in broad terms what information is in each dataset.",

    "section": "Immigration Enforcement Actions and their Data Footprints",
    "text": "Immigration Enforcement Actions and their Data Footprints\nA deportation case typically starts either at the border (with an arrest along the border or a determination of inadmissibility at a port of entry), or in the interior (with an ICE arrest). After the initial arrest, the first key question is whether the case will move along a fast track or proceed in immigration court. Fast-track removals can begin with either ICE or CBP, and include expedited removal (until recently, limited to arrests at the border), reinstatement of removal (for individuals previously removed from the United States), or (more recently) expulsion under an emergency executive authority. If a fast-track removal does not occur, cases are typically adjudicated in immigration court, where EOIR tracks outcomes.\nEach part of these processes is trackable in data from these three agencies. I describe the available data from CBP, ICE, and EOIR in turn, with examples of how these datasets have been and can be used.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Data\nBorder Patrol logs each arrest that it makes, and the CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) logs each time it determines that someone is inadmissible at a port of entry. The Deportation Data Project collects and posts both of these publicly available CBP datasets. Much, but not all, of this data is also posted in the CBP FOIA Reading Room. Individual-level data is currently available for the period from October 1, 2007, to September 2024, but the dataset has a recent hole: it is missing records of Title 42 expulsions (summary expulsions at the border on public health grounds) from June 2022 through September 2022. (Of course, updates may be posted at any time; when they are, the Deportation Data Project will repost them.)\nThe Border Patrol arrest data includes the date of each arrest; the nationality, gender, and age of each arrestee; whether that arrestee was a single adult, an unaccompanied child, or part of a family; and (in most periods) the border sector in which the arrest occurred. The dataset typically also logs the disposition following the arrest: whether the person was subjected to Title 42 expulsion, expedited removal proceedings, reinstatement of removal proceedings, or standard removal proceedings in immigration court. The dataset includes a variety of other information, recorded with varying degrees of consistency. The most recent two years of data also include several other useful fields, including the date of each person’s earliest arrest (often but not always the same as the current arrest date) and the person’s city of origin. The Deportation Data Project data page contains more details.\nBorder Patrol arrest data tells one part of the story of border enforcement; the other part is told by records from the Office of Field Operations (OFO), which staffs ports of entry. When someone appears at a port of entry without a valid visa, typically to seek asylum, the OFO logs the results. This dataset, posted along with the Border Patrol data on the Deportation Data Project data page, looks similar to the Border Patrol arrest dataset, with the same demographic and disposition information, along with a record of when each person was booked out of CBP custody.\nExamples of existing uses:\n\nThe Cato Institute and the Migration Policy Institute, among others, have repeatedly used CBP data in analyses of border arrests and port entry arrivals over time.\nMichael Clemens has used CBP data tracking city of origin to examine the effect of violence on decisions to migrate.\n\nPossible future uses:\n\nCould evaluate changes in patterns of both apprehensions and the dispositions resulting from those apprehensions, under the new administration.\nCould evaluate the effects of changes in state policies that might affect border arrivals.\nCould evaluate the effects of military presence on the southern border.\n\n\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Data\nIf CBP does not immediately expel or return a person it has arrested, it typically either releases that person with a Notice to Appear in immigration court or transfers the person to ICE custody, at which point ICE decides whether to continue detaining or release the person. ICE also conducts its own arrests, mostly in the interior of the United States, and most commonly within jails and prisons. Finally, when people lose their cases, ICE conducts deportations, whether those people were arrested at the border or in the interior.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no way in public data to determine which CBP arrests correspond to which ICE enforcement actions. But thanks to a recent Second Circuit case (on which I worked as an attorney and a consultant), it is now black-letter law that agencies must replace private identifiers with anonymized unique IDs if those private identifiers are needed to link different parts of an agency’s database.2\n2 See ACLU v. ICE, supra note 1, at 663-64.As a result, within the ICE data, individuals now have an anonymous unique identifier. The internally linked ICE data is available for fiscal years 2012 to 2023 and contains four tables (i.e. spreadsheets in which each row corresponds to a given event). First, an arrest table logs the date of each arrest and the arrest method—whether it occurred in a local jail, for example, or through a 287(g) agreement (an agreement that deputizes state or local law enforcement officers to perform certain functions of federal immigration agents). Second, a risk classification assessment table logs ICE’s assessment of each individual’s flight risk and danger to the community. Third, a detention table logs every book-in to detention and corresponding book-out from detention, allowing tracking of detention and transfers nationwide. Finally, a deportations table tracks every deportation that ICE conducts. All four of these tables contain a column with a unique ID corresponding (anonymously) to each person’s alien file number, also known as A-number. By matching these unique IDs across tables, it is possible to track a person’s enforcement path from arrest to detention to deportation within the ICE data. In addition, the unique IDs allow rows within a single table to be grouped by person; a single person may appear in multiple rows if, for example, that person was transferred between detention centers.\nTogether, the ICE data allows detailed tracking of the number and types of deportations, along with information about the detention that preceded those deportations.\nThe linked ICE dataset has key shortcomings, however. First, it is out of date. It is missing records not only from the last month but also from the last year-plus of the Biden administration.\nSecond, the linked ICE dataset does not include several categories of information that ICE has routinely released without unique IDs. These nonlinked data categories include records of the locations of ICE arrests, records of detainer requests (requests to jails and prisons to hold noncitizens beyond their release dates), and records of which deportations resulted from such detainers requests. The Deportation Data Project is seeking these additional categories of data with unique IDs. In the meantime, the Project’s website makes available the existing versions of these datasets, which are out of date and lack unique IDs.\nExamples of existing uses:\n\nAcademics have used ICE data to study immigration detention, sanctuary, and deportation patterns.\nJournalists have used ICE data extensively. For example, Bloomberg News recently used ICE data to examine the detention of asylum seekers, and the New York Times was an early user of ICE deportation data, reporting on Obama-era deportations.\nThe Vera Institute has used ICE data to create a detention dashboard that tracks detention use across detention centers and over time.\n\nPossible future uses:\n\nCould be used to map swiftly changing patterns in locations and types of arrests and deportations.\nCould be used to track the creation and expansion of immigration detention centers.\nCould be used to study the relationship between arrests, detentions and deportations.\n\n\n\nImmigration Court Data\nWhen arrested noncitizens are not swiftly deported (whether in a Title 42 expulsion, an expedited removal, or a reinstatement of removal), they typically fight their case in the immigration courts. These administrative courts are run by EOIR, a division of the Department of Justice. EOIR releases by far the most comprehensive and frequently updated immigration enforcement dataset. The CASE dataset, posted on the EOIR FOIA library page, contains a wealth of information on every immigration court case since the 1990s, including the immigration charges against each person (i.e. the reason why the government is seeking deportation), any applications for relief from removal (such as asylum or family-based relief), the date and time of every hearing scheduled in the case, indication of legal representation, the outcome of the case, and, when applicable, an appeal.\nThe immigration court dataset is the best known of these datasets, and it forms the basis for popular visualization tools created by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which also first obtained the dataset via FOIA. The Deportation Data Project links to the EOIR FOIA library and also allows a direct download of the dataset for convenience.\nUnfortunately, the EOIR dataset, like the ICE and CBP datasets, is currently not linked with any other agencies’ data. The Deportation Data Project is pursuing FOIA requests for such links.\nExamples of existing uses:\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse has created an extensive set of visual tools that allowed access to the immigration court data.\nThe EOIR dataset has given rise to at least dozens and perhaps hundreds of academic articles and books on the immigration court system. This Google Scholar search offers an incomplete list.\nJournalists have frequently used the EOIR dataset to track policy.

That means the datasets contain a row for each individual immigration enforcement action (such as arrest or removal). This allows the user to conduct analysis–for example, to count the number of arrests that occurred in a given area of responsibility. We do not conduct analysis ourselves (although we hope to have the capacity to do so in the future). That means that we do not provide counts, reports, or summary statistics. Instead, if you see counts or summary statistics attributed to the Deportation Data Project, that means someone downloaded data from our website and used it to conduct analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does the ICE data come from?\n\n\n\n\nThe data comes from ICE itself in response to FOIA requests. In most cases, we provide the raw data ICE provided without modification. We note any time we have modified the data, such as to make it possible to open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the Deportation Data Project obtain these data?\n\n\n\n\nWe obtained these data through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy with our assistance. After ICE did not respond to the request for six months, CILP filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in December 2024 to compel the release of the data. CILP is represented in the litigation by members of our team. The first data release under CILP v ICE was produced by ICE in March 2025, and to date we have received three more updates in early June, late June, and late July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should I cite ICE data from the Deportation Data Project?\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend: “government data provided by ICE in response to a FOIA request to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by [your organization].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will you update these datasets?\n\n\n\n\nWe promptly post data that we receive from ICE, but ICE has not agreed to release these datasets on any schedule, so it is impossible to predict when, or at what intervals, we will receive updates. We are actively seeking updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I access the data?\n\n\n\n\nYou can access the data in the tables below. Each table has a “Download” column with a link to download the data as an Excel file. The most recent release is also available as a ZIP file with all of the tables together. You can open them directly in Microsoft Excel or another spreadsheet program or read them into a statistical software such as R or Stata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a data dictionary or codebook?\n\n\n\n\nYes, we compiled what we know about the ICE data in a codebook. Our understanding is very incomplete. More generally, our data guide provides an overview of US immigration enforcement data across the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I filter arrests data to my state, city, or neighborhood?\n\n\n\n\nYes, but imperfectly. Three variables (columns) may be useful: “Area of Responsibility,” “Landmark,” and “State.” Each is useful, but also incomplete. The state variable is accurate, but sometimes missing. The Area of Responsibility variable, which represents the coverage area of an ICE field office, is geographically coarse; some areas encompass very large regions. ICE provides some information on the coverage areas. The Landmark refers to a place near the arrest and is sometimes the most geographically-specific, but it is inconsistently used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw your warning about removals data. How can I get the best picture of deportations?\n\n\n\n\nWe did not receive correct removals data in our latest release (for late July). If you are interested in analyzing removals for the first half of 2025, we recommend using the removals data from late June 2025 (covering only the period beginning in January 2025). Unfortunately, we believe the removals data we posted in the previous, early June 2025, release was incomplete, even with respect to the period it covered. We did not post removals data at all in the late February or late July releases due to apparent errors. In each case (again with the exception of the 2025 data from late June 2025), we discovered many fewer removals in the data provided than in other publicly available sources. These concerns lead us to advise caution when performing any analysis of removals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI noticed that there are some duplicates in the arrests data. How should I account for those?\n\n\n\n\nNo approach should change estimates dramatically, since only about 5% of rows involve potential duplicates. There are several types of potential duplicates in the data and multiple reasonable approaches to resolving them. First, there are 38 duplicates across all fields (where the unique identifier is not missing). These 38 seem clearly to be duplicates and can be dropped. Second, there are close to 6,000 rows involving more than one arrest of the same individual on the same apprehension date. It is less clear whether these are duplicates or reflect actual repeated arrests on the same day, which seems unlikely but conceivable. Three types in particular are worth mentioning. First, many of the duplicates involve a row with a case status that reads “E-Charging Document Canceled by ICE”; these seem likely to be duplicates, but it’s not always clear which row to retain, since in some cases the row with the “E-Charging Document Canceled by ICE” status includes more information (i.e. sometimes that row includes an apprehension landmark, whereas the other row for the same person does not). Second, many rows are identical across all fields apart from the time stamp; for these rows, we think it would be reasonable to choose just the later row. Third, many rows have not only identical dates and unique IDs, but also identical times stamps. It also seems safe to assume that these are duplicates. In sum, there are several ways to screen for duplicates, and correct choices are not obvious. Luckily, no choice should lead to large differences in estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I identify courtroom arrests in the data?\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately we do not know of a good way to identify arrests at courthouses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I identify raids in communities in the data, as opposed to arrests at check-ins or a jail or prison?\n\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to fully isolate arrests that take place in communities (as opposed to within jails or prisons, for example). However, there are two indicators that may be useful: in the arrests table when “Apprehension Method” is “Located” or “Non-Custodial Arrest” we think that these records are more likely to indicate arrests in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I tell whether detainers are honored by local and state jails and prisons?\n\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be any way to determine from these data whether a jail or prison is holding individuals for up to 48 hours in response to a detainer request. However, there are ways to determine whether an individual is booked into ICE detention following a detainer request. The “Detainer Lift Reason” field in the detainers table includes values that likely represent detainer refusals (“Detainer Declined by LEA”) and some that may represent accepting detainers (“Booked into Detention”). However, that field is often missing. If the field is missing, it may mean that the person remains in criminal custody, the detainer was not honored, or that ICE has not yet updated the record to indicate whether it was honored. A second way to confirm whether the individual was transferred to ICE custody following a detainer request is to join the detainers table to the detentions table by unique ID. If the unique ID in the detainers table does not appear in the detentions table, it is possible that the detainer was not honored. Note, however, that the individual may still be in criminal custody. If the unique ID does appear in the detentions table, that means the individual was booked into ICE custody following a detainer request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo these data include all immigration arrests, detentions, and removals by the US government?\n\n\n\n\nNo, they only include actions by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). ICE ERO is generally responsible for civil immigration arrests in the interior of the United States, away from international borders (Austin Kocher’s Substack discusses the ICE arrests data in detail). Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducts arrests and detentions at or near the border. Some people arrested by CBP are transferred for detention and removal by ICE. CBP also refuses entry and removes people deemed inadmissible at the border. We post data from CBP on arrests (encounters) and people deemed inadmissible at the border. CBP has not released data as recently as ICE has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I identify removals to third countries?\n\n\n\n\nEvery table has a column for “Departed Country,” which indicates where individuals were removed to. To identify third-country removals in which a noncitizen was deported to a country other than their country of citizenship, compare those countries to the “Citizenship Country” and/or the “Birth Country” column. The “Citizenship Country” may not include all nationalities in the case of dual citizenship and, as with all data, errors are possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would data for the same individual change between releases?\n\n\n\n\nICE appears to update records retroactively in a relatively small number of cases, including by changing the arrests, encounters, detainers, and detentions tables when a removal takes place. This may result in slightly different patterns in overlapping periods of two data releases. We do not know whether there is a schedule or systematic procedure dictating when these updates occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there many rows per person in the detention table?\n\n\n\n\nEach row in the detentions table represents time in a specific detention facility from book-in to book-out. A person arrested by ICE might be transferred to multiple facilities during their detention, represented in multiple rows. Overall, ICE refers to the whole detention period (from book-in to the first detention to book-out from the last detention center) as a “stay.” A stay often includes multiple book-ins to different detention centers, and one person (identified anonymously by unique ID) can have multiple stays (if released from detention and later detained again). See our ICE codebook for further explanation of the detentions data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it appear that the data is missing arrests/encounters/detainers/detentions/removals for some months?\n\n\n\n\nSome of the spreadsheets are split over multiple sheets. The sheets should be stacked before being analyzed.",

That is, users can only connect the tables in the earlier dataset and the later dataset separately; IDs do not match across releases.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Deportation Data Project collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets. We use the Freedom of Information Act to gather datasets directly from the government, and we also post datasets that the government has posted proactively or in response to others’ requests. We expect these datasets to be used by journalists, researchers, lawyers, and policymakers.\nWe post mostly individual-level datasets. Individual-level data is most useful to those with a background in data analysis, allowing these users to make their own decisions about how to analyze the data.\nWe write documentation for each dataset, including its limitations and how it was obtained. We also provide a codebook for ICE data, which includes information about the variables in the dataset, their definitions, and their values. In addition, we post documentation from the agencies.\nWe are grateful for the work of others, and especially of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), in first obtaining access to many of these datasets. Please get in touch if you have done relevant work in this area and we can do more to acknowledge your contributions."
