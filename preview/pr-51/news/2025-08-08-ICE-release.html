The Deportation Data Project has obtained a new release of nationwide, individual-level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, now covering the period from September 1, 2023 to July 29, 2025. The new dataset extends the previous (early June) release by approximately one month. As in the previous release, it includes five tables tracking encounters, detainers, arrests, detentions and removals respectively. 

Unfortunately, again as in the previous release, the removals table only includes records from Jan. 1, 2025 onward because the records from before Jan. 1, 2025 appeared to have significant errors. In addition, the removals dataset in this latest release (late June) includes significantly more records, for the same date range, than the removals dataset in the previous release (early June). We therefore urge users not to rely on the previous, early June, release of the removals table, and to exercise extreme caution in using the removals table at all.

The new dataset, like the ones released in June and July, was obtained through a FOIA lawsuit against ICE brought by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, represented by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and Amber Qureshi of the Deportation Data Project. The dataset includes anonymized identifiers that correspond to individuals, allowing users to follow individuals through the enforcement process without learning their identities.
