title: "About the Deportation Data Project"
---

The Deportation Data Project collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets. We use the Freedom of Information Act to gather datasets directly from the government, and we also post datasets that the government has posted proactively or in response to others’ requests. We expect these datasets to be used by journalists, researchers, lawyers, and policymakers.

We post mostly [individual-level datasets](data.html). Individual-level data is most useful to those with a background in data analysis, allowing these users to make their own decisions about how to analyze the data.

We write [documentation](guide.html) for each dataset, including its limitations and how it was obtained. We also provide a codebook for ICE data, which includes information about the variables in the dataset, their definitions, and their values. In addition, we post documentation from the agencies.

We also provide [links to related projects](related.html) that offer analyses, visualizations, and reports for journalists, attorneys, and the public based on these datasets. 

We are grateful for the work of others, and especially of the [Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)](https://tracreports.org), in first obtaining access to many of these datasets. Please get in touch if you have done relevant work in this area and we can do more to acknowledge your contributions.

## Team

We are academics and lawyers who share a commitment to transparency in immigration enforcement data.
